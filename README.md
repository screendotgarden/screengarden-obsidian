## For testers

For those with screen.garden accounts, you can install this plugin either manually or using the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin.

### Installing using BRAT

BRAT is a beta-testing tool for plugins. It helps you install and update beta versions of plugins based on some additional metadata in this repo. If you’d like to install screen.garden using BRAT:

1. [Install the BRAT plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian42-brat).
2. Run the `BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing` command and paste in `https://github.com/screendotgarden/screengarden-obsidian`.
3. Click Add Plugin.
4. Navigate to Community Plugins in Obsidian settings, click the refresh button, find screen.garden, and enable it.

### Installing manually

To install manually, you'll need to:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/screendotgarden/screengarden-obsidian/releases).
2. Find the folder named `.obsidian/plugins` in your vault and open it.
3. In that folder, create a new folder named `screengarden-obsidian`.
4. Copy the files from the latest release and paste them into the folder you created.
5. Navigate to Community Plugins in Obsidian settings, click the refresh button, find screen.garden, and enable it.

After installing via either method you should have screen.garden panes available in both the left and right sidebars of Obsidian. Use the links in one of those to register or log in.
